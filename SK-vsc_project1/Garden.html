                            <p> The Bay Area Young Survivors (BAYS) Breast Cancer Memorial Garden is the first permanent
                                memorial of its kind in the United States dedicated to lives lost to breast cancer. The
                                memorial honors the strength and spirit of those who have died and the community of
                                survivors that continue to carry their legacy forward. Located at the junction of
                                Arguello Boulevard and Conservatory Drive, this meaningful new space is the result of an
                                11-year collaboration between Rec and Park and BAYS, a volunteer-led nonprofit that
                                supports individuals diagnosed with breast cancer aged 45 and under.</p>

                            <p> Golden Gate Park never stops blooming, and its gardeners never stop working. The entire
                                park is a garden created out of sand dunes by gardeners’ hands in the 1870s, and
                                generations of gardeners since then have planted many rare and exotic plants throughout
                                the park. And because San Francisco has very little frost and ample winter rain, there
                                is always something growing, flowering, going to seed, or changing color here. Although
                                Golden Gate Park has beautiful destination gardens, it was designed for folks to “get
                                lost.” Wander any trail and you will find interesting features, surprising plants,
                                magnificent tree groves, and sunny glades, including this delightful little garden of
                                camellias.

                                Environmentally sustainable practices are emphasized here, both in the garden’s design

                                1879, is the oldest building in Golden Gate Park and one of San Francisco’s most beloved
                                landmarks. It houses some 1,700 species of aquatic and tropical plants, many of them
                                rare, including a 100-year-old giant Imperial philodendron, a world-renowned collection
                                of orchids, giant water lilies, and carnivorous plants. Special exhibits have included
                                such popular favorites as the Butterfly Zone and the miniature garden railroad.
                                Admission to the Conservatory of Flowers is free to San Francisco residents and all
                                veterans.

                            <p> Plans to build the Dahlia Garden were introduced in 1940 by Interstate Commerce
                                Commission Director Richard T. Eddy and Park Superintendent John McLaren. Their intent
                                was to cultivate dahlia species from all over the world and create an international
                                garden. Located inside the oval of the Conservatory driveway turnaround, the
                                kidney-shaped garden is tended by the Dahlia Society of California, whose members
                                nurture its some 1,000 plants into full bloom by late August. </p>

                            <p> This secluded hillside spot was developed in 1940 to showcase fuchsias. Originally
                                called the Golden Gate Fuchsia Grove, the hillside garden was created by the Park
                                Department. Little is known of its early history, but the original fuchsia plants most
                                likely came from the 1939 Golden Gate International Exposition (GGIE), noted for the
                                fuchsias featured in some of its landscaping. Park Superintendent John McLaren was a
                                special adviser to the GGIE fair commission and was known to have recycled many
                                plantings from the Panama-Pacific International Exposition to the park many years
                                earlier. In the middle of the dell there is a brass sundial on top of a square masonry
                                pedestal that was placed in 1983.</p>

                            <p>The Japanese Tea Garden in Golden Gate Park is the oldest in the United States, created
                                for the 1894 California Midwinter International Exposition as the fair’s Japanese
                                Village exhibit. The garden’s lush, harmonious landscaping pays homage to the

                                chosen and manicured plants, including graceful Japanese maples, twisting pines, clipped
                                azaleas, and cherry trees that put on a spectacular flowering display in March and

                            <p>Below the towering Dutch Windmill is the Queen Wilhelmina Garden, where some 10,000 tulip
                                bulbs planted each fall blossom the following March; interspersed with Iceland poppies,
                                the tulips seem even more glorious and colorful. The bowl-shaped garden was designed by
                                Roy L. Hudson and named in 1962 to honor the long-reigning queen of the Netherlands, who
                                had died that same year. Tulips, the emblem of perfect love, originate from central Asia
                                and Turkey, from where they were introduced into Europe and the Americas in the 17th
                                century.

                            <h4>John F. Kennedy Drive, near the Music Concourse</h4>
                            <p>The Rhododendron Dell is a 20-acre site, located in the heart of Golden Gate Park along
                                Kennedy Drive near the Music Concourse. It was designed to honor John McLaren, the
                                father of Golden Gate Park, with over 850 varieties of his favorite flower. The area
                                includes a pathway system by which a visitor can view the collection. The Dell dates
                                back to the early 1950s. Rhododendrons in Golden Gate Park are truly a labor of love
                                because growing conditions have made it difficult to sustain healthy, long-lasting
                                plants in the past. However, recent renovations and advanced gardening techniques have
                                ensured the existence of the blooms – which provide a visual delight in the springtime.

                            <p>Until January 8, 1961, San Francisco had no municipal rose garden, although a two-acre
                                informal one had existed in the park on Stanyan Street between Oak and Page Streets
                                early in the century. Today, the park’s Rose Garden contains examples ranging from a
                                simple single five-petal configuration of the wild rose to hybridized elegant blooms in
                                a wide variety of sizes, shapes, and fragrances. These delicately perfumed blossoms are
                                a universal symbol of love and romance and offer the perfect backdrop for a budding
                                relationship.
