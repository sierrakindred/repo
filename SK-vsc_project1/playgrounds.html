                            <p>This charming playground, tucked behind the trees on the southwestern edge of the park,
                                is a
                                great place for your next family party! Kids will love the ocean-themed play structures,

                            <p>This playground is centrally located, with convenient access to the California Academy of
                                Sciences and the de Young Museum. It’s a great place to take the kids and let them burn

                                energy. Though it officially has no name, this playground is commonly known as Blue

                            <p>Generations of San Franciscans have fond memories of the children’s playground and
                                carousel in
                                Golden Gate Park’s southeast corner. The playground, called the Sharon Quarters for
                                Children
                                when it opened in 1888, is thought to have been the nation’s first public playground. In
                                that
                                era, the idea of providing a dedicated space solely for youth recreation was
                                groundbreaking.
                                With generous support from the Koret Foundation, the playground underwent a major
                                renovation and
                                reopened in 2007 as the Koret Children’s Quarter. The historic concrete slides remain
                                the star
                                attraction of this playground. A charming 1914 Herschell-Spillman Company Carousel
                                offers rides
                                to the young and young-at-heart.</p>

                            <p>Mother’s Meadow was originally designated as a safe haven for parents and their children

                                Golden Gate Park formally accommodated popular yet more hazardous pastimes in the park,
                                such as
                                racing horses. Ever since, endless picnics and play dates have unfolded at the grassy

                                located just off of Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive, and is now considered one of the most
